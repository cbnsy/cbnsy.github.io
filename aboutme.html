<p> Hey everyone, as you may have known from the website I’m Terence and I am 18 years old. I’m a Filipino that has been born and raised in New Zealand. I have lived in New Zealand my entire life, although through this wonderful sport of basketball I have been able to travel to such amazing places that I never thought I’d get to visit. Born in Auckland, North Shore life has been pretty exciting with lots of many things and experiences along the way. Whether that's playing sports, learning instruments or whatever it is, Auckland has presented so many opportunities to me to go and live the life I want to. Now this website is a presentation about my basketball skills and highlights so let's take it to where it began. My first memory of playing basketball is when I was 6. My dad took me to a NZ Breakers basketball camp. It was such a fun experience and ever since then my love for the game of basketball began to grow. Joining the basketball team in primary school and just improving and getting better over the years, going into intermediate and eventually highschool. A few quick facts about me, I'm ambidextrous in a way. I'm a natural born lefty although a lot of small skills like writing, holding things with my right hand. I used to also play tennis and squash. I once came 4th in a Tennis Tournament when I was still in primary. I use the number 22 as it's my Dad’s birthday day, stuck with it ever since Year 8. I also play League of Legends and Valorant, although I’m not the best player at it. Hope you learnt a two or thing about me as a person and I hope you continue to follow my journey as a basketball player. </p>
